# SQL_Alchemy

Queried climate data of Honolulu, Hawaii to observe 12-months of precipitation and station activity throughout the island.

## Climate Analysis and Exploration

Python and SQLAlchemy used for a climate analysis and data exploration in a Jupyter Lab notebook and .sqlite file.

The following languages used to organize and visualize data: SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Precipitation Analysis

1. Structured and sorted a pandas dataFrame to provide data by date and precipitation levels.  
2. Built a matplotlib graph to display daily precipitation

## Station Analysis
1. Queries designed to calculate the total number of stations, the most active stations & stations with the highest number of temperature observation data (tobs).
2. Designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).
3. Results plotted  as a histogram.
